	There are 6 buildings in the MAISEL, from U1 to U6:</br>
	The U1, U2 and U4 are the ones located in the main buildings near the class rooms. The U3 is also on the campus but it is a little bit isolated because it is near the sports facilities (beach volley, gymnasium, tennis court…). The U5, which has spacious rooms, is in front of the school, you just have to cross the street. The U6, built in 2005, is on the cathedral place near the mall center Evry 2.</br>
	Except for the U6, students don’t have kitchens in their rooms; they just have a small fridge. However, all the buildings have a well-equipped kitchen (oven, microwave, electric plate). You can also eat at the RITS.</br>
