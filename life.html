	<h1 id="bank">Bank account</h1>
		<p>Managing your money in a foreign country is not an easy thing, that is why Welcom is here to give you advice.</p>
		
		<h2>How to open a bank account in France?</h2>
		<p>To open a bank account, you need to bring these documents to the banker:</br></br>
			A proof of identity (ID, passport)</br>
			A proof of residence (please contact the Maisel)</br>
			Société générale, BNP and LCL are the three main banks in Evry.</br>
			Notice that Société général will also be on duty on the campus (in the forum) every Thursday from 10am to 1pm throughout all the school year except for holidays and bank holidays.</br>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Checks</h2>
		<p>
			Checks in France are often used, especially to have a mobile phone or rent an apartment.</br>
			Your credit card (about 30€ per year) and your checkbook (free) will arrive one week after your account opening.</br>
			Your code number will be sent in your Maisel address, so be careful about your information.</br>
			Do not hesitate to give your mobile phone number to your bank in case they need some more information. In case of loss or theft of the credit card or check book, you must immediately stop the card or check book (“faire opposition”) by calling the phone number your bank gave you.</br>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Travelers Checks</h2>
		<p>Traveler's checks are NOT easy to cash in France, because you must go to a bank and banking hours are not very practical.</br>
		You can instead use an international credit card such as Visa or MasterCard. American Express is recognized as well but is far less easily accepted.</br>
		As well, if your credit card has a pin code, almost all ATMs will allow you to withdraw Euros using these credit cards. But be sure to check with your bank concerning the charges and exchange rate applied when using the card in France in shops AND withdrawing money from ATMs.</br>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Euro bills</h2>
		<p>If you exchange money before you come, remember to ask for small denomination bank notes /euro bills as it is extremely difficult to get stores and even bank accept a 200 or more euro bill.</br>
		Be aware that there is a Société Générale ATM on the campus.</br>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Lost with Euros?</h2>
		<p>
		Here is the website to convert your money in Euros.
		<a href="http://www.xe.com">http://www.xe.com</a>
		</p>
		<h2>Others spendings</h2>
		<p>
		During your journey, you will spend a lot of money at your arrival:</br></br>

		Your rent (which depends on your Maisel room).</br>

		Note that you can benefit from the CAF which pays you a part of your rent.</br>

		Maisel membership cost (around 150€ non-refund)</br>

		Maisel deposit (arounf 450€)</br>

		House insurance (around 40€ for one year, please contact school life office)</br>

		Food</br>

		Dishes (5 €)</br>

		Public transport: count 70€/month for unlimited trips with the Imagin’r Card</br>

		Others: clothes, associations, school stationery…</br>

		Have a look at this webpage so you will know the average price for average product in France.</br>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Need help?</h2>
		<p>
		If you have some personal, financial or social difficulties, a social worker can inform you, give advices or direct you the competent services.</br>
		She is here every Tuesday; you can make an appointment in the infirmary office.</br>

	<h2>Formalities and residence permit</h2>

	There are many administrative procedures you must do when you arrive in France:</br></br>
	Enroll in your school</br>
	Open a bank account</br>
	Subscribe to an insurance</br>
	Validate your visa or obtain a residence permit</br>
	
	<h2>Visa and residence permit</h2>
	This chapter is dedicated to the visa and the residence permit.</br>
	<h2>I. EUROPEAN STUDENTS</h2>

	You are an EA citizen (ie from 1 of the 27 European Union countries, Liechtenstein, Norway or Iceland) or from Switzerland: you don’t need a resident’s permit in order to study in France, just your identity card or a valid passport and the European Health Insurance Card.</br>
	<h2>II. NON-EUROPEAN STUDENTS</h2>

	To study in France, non-European students must hold a long stay visa called « VLS-TS ». This visa is valid for 6 months up to 1 year and must be validated when you arrive in France.</br>

	Students who are already in France and hold a residence permit must renew it two months before the end of the permit.</br>

	If you are Algerian, you are entitled to a long stay 3-month visa. On you arrival, you must apply for the residence permit.</br>

	For the procedure, please refer to the second part “Obtain or renew the residence permit”.</br>

	If you are Romanian or Bulgarian and do not hold a Master 2 degree, you need a residence permit in case you would like to work in France. To obtain the residence permit, please follow the second part “Obtain or renew the residence permit”.</br>

	<h2>a. Validating the VLS-TS</h2>

	When you got back your passport with the visa, the French Authorities also gave you a special stamped form: Demande d’Attestation OFII.</br>

	Upon your arrival in France, this form has to be filled out with your definitive postal address (MAISEL’s address) and your contact details (email and phone) and signed.</br>

	Once you have filled out and signed the attestation, you should give it to the person in charge of foreign student affairs at TSP or TEM with:</br></br>
	<ul>
	<li>A copy of your passport</li>
	<li>A copy of the visa</li>
	<li>A copy of the page with the date of entry in France (stamp from the customs)</li>
	</ul>
	
	Complete applications will be sent to the OFII center based in Créteil, then, one week later, you will receive an acknowledgement.</br>

	After two weeks, you will receive another letter from OFII summoning you for a medical examination. The mail is composed of three pages:</br></br>
	First page: date and time of the appointment and documents you have to bring with you</br>
	Second page: how to reach the OFII center</br>
	Third page: payment of the tax.</br></br>
	The tax stamp: you have to pay the fees as a stamp bearing the initials “OMI”. You can buy this stamp:</br></br>
	Online from <a href="https://www.timbresofii.fr/">https://www.timbresofii.fr/</a>
	In some tobacco shops</br>
	At offices of the French tax authorities.</br>
	At the end of the medical visit, your visa will be validated (they will stick a sort of label on your passport) and you will get a medical certificate. You don’t need a residence permit because the visa gives you the same rights, that means:</br></br>
	You can travel</br>
	You can complete all the administrative procedures</br>
	You can work (part-time job 60%)</br></br>
	<blockquote>TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE END OF THE VISA, YOU HAVE TO APPLY FOR THE RESIDENCE PERMIT.</blockquote>
	
	<h2>b. Applying or renewing the residence permit</h2>

	You have to apply for or renew the residence permit at the Police Administrative Headquarters (Préfecture) for the area where you live 2 MONTHS before the end of your papers.</br>
	For Evry, it is “Préfecture de l’Essonne”, a 5 minute-walk from our campus.</br>

	The procedure is the same for both VLS-TS or residence permit.</br>

	<strong>Step1</strong>. You print the form with the list of documents requested from the website of the Police Administrative Headquarters (Préfecture de l’Essonne): <a href="http://www.essonne.gouv.fr/sejour-etrangers/index.html">http://www.essonne.gouv.fr/sejour-etrangers/index.html</a>.</br>

	DON’T PANIC! Everything is in French but if you follow carefully the instructions, it will be easy:</br></br>
	Click on “Formulaire” in the red header</br>
	Select your nationality and click « OK »</br>
	“type de demande”, they ask you the topic of your request, you select “renouvellement de titre de séjour”</br>
	They ask you…again “type de demande”, you have to give your status, you select “étudiant” (student)</br></br>
	
	<strong>Step2</strong>. Now, there is a long sentence written in black and a kind of violet color. This first sentence tells you to go to the “Préfecture” with your passport, the form and the materials requested.</br>

	To get the form you click on “formulaire et des pieces jointes” (in violet). A form (in French) appears. The first part has to be filled in with your personal details and the second part is the list of documents you have to prepare:</br></br>
	<ul>
		<li> Original and copy of the passport</li>
		<li> Original and copy of the VLS-TS and the OFII label OR original and copy of your residence permit</li>
		<li> Copy of your transcript of records</li>
		<li> “attestation d’assiduité”, on this letter the school certifies that you are regularly enrolled in a program and you regularly attend the courses</li>
		<li> Evidence of financial support (scholarship, personal funds…)</li>
		<li> Evidence of residence in Evry or in the Essonne Area</li>
		<li> 3 photos</li>
	</ul>
	If you hold a VLS-TS, you add:</br></br>
	<ul>
		<li> Original and copy of your birth certificate in French</li>
		<li>Original and copy of the OFII medical certificate</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>ALL THE DOCUMENTS MUST BE IN FRENCH. If you need to translate a document into French, a list of official translators is available in Dir 209.</blockquote>

	<strong>Step3</strong>. To have an appointment, you return to the last page and click on “prendre rendez-vous” (second sentence).</br>
	You will thus open a page with the title “ACCUEIL”, you select the first proposition “EVRY: Prise de Rendez-vous pour les ressortissants étrangers titulaires d’un titre avec la mention “étudiant”:</br></br>
	<ul>
		<li>MODULE DE RESERVATION DE LA PREFECTURE : it is a short presentation of the system with the legal mentions and condition of confirmation. You have to tick the box at the bottom of the page to accept the conditions and click on “Effectuer une demande de reservation”</li>
		<li>“Choix de la nature de réservation” : you select the first proposition and click on « Etape suivante » and you chose a day and time for your appointment</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>You may have 30 minutes to confirm the appointment from your mailbox.</strong>

	On the appointed day, you go to the “Préfecture” with your documents and the mail confirming the appointment. Once your complete application is accepted, you will be issued with a receipt that serves as an interim residence permit.</br>
	You will receive your annual residence permit within 2 to 3 weeks.</br>

	If you have any question, you can contact:</br></br>

	<h2>Healthcare reimbursement</h2>
	Procedures that need to be done in france:</br>

	A form should be filled by your nominated treating doctor, and returned to the Social Security.</br>

	You may download the special n°12485 Cerfa form (Déclaration de choix du médecin traitant) here: <a href="http://www.ameli.fr">www.ameli.fr</a>, or get it from the	nurse. You should fill out the form with the doctor on the first occasion (he or she doesn’t have to be the campus doctor). Don’t make unnecessary appointments; you should wait until you have a good reason to visit the doctor.</br>

	A duly filled out form should be sent to your social security organism (LMDE or SMEREP).</br>
	If possible, you should always visit your nominated treating doctor, should the need arise, he’ll refer you to specialized doctors.
	Besides emergencies or evidence-based diseases, if you don’t choose a nominated treating doctor, or if you visit another doctor,
	the reimbursement rate will be lower (16 € instead of 19 €).</br>

	To go from Paris to the campus, you need to take an RER, the green one: line D.</br>
	 A RER is just a train that goes between suburbs. It only takes you 45 minutes to get to the center of Paris.Have a look at Wikipedia if you want more information!</br>
	 You have to take the RER either at metro/RER station CHATELET, GARE du NORD or GARE DE LYON. There, you have to find line RER D direction:</br>
	•Corbeil</br>
	•Melun</br>
	•Malesherbes</br></br>

	Every train in this direction and with a “P” in the third letter will take you to the campus, for example: riPe, biPe, ziPe, tiPe, roPo, zoPo, etc.</br>
	 You will learn also that each letter means something, in this case, the letter “P” means that the train will pass through the branch of Evry Courcouronnes / Bras de Fer, where our stop is!</br>
	 For the timetable, you can take one of the brochures in the train station or look in “Fiches Horaires” or on RATP</br>
	 To get to the campus you have to stop at Evry Courcouronnes.</br></br>

	 

	<h2>Coming by plane</h2>

	Most of the International Students decide to come to Paris by plane. There are 3 differents airports in Paris: CDG, Orly and Beauvais.</br></br>


	Welcom organises in September and January a pickup service for 30€. However sometimes, this service cannot not be provided. Here is some information on how to reach our campus from one of the 3 airports. From each of these airports, different transportations are available that imply diverse costs.</br></br>

	<b>Charles de Gaulle Airport by taxi</b></br>

	Taking a taxi is usually the easiest way to get to Évry with heavy suitcases but you should take into account that it implies a minimum of 150 euros.</br>
	 If there are more than 4 of you, each extra person will be charged 20 euros and there is an extra fee if you have more than 6 suitcases. Charles de Gaulle Airport has 3 terminals divided into zones. Each zone has its own taxi service:</br>
